    <div>Transcriber’s Note</div>
  </div>
</div>

  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>Obvious punctuation and spelling errors corrected.
    </li>
    <li>Original variations in spelling retained, e.g. cup plates/cup-plates, candle
    sticks/candlesticks, slip ware/slipware.
    </li>
    <li>The Collector’s Data section that begins on page 97 in the original ran for four full
    pages, presumably to give the readers space to make their own notes. The amount of blank
    space has been reduced here, and the repeating headers consolidated to a single one.
    </li>
    <li>There is a “2” at the top of page 65 in the original which has been retained, though
    it may be a misprint. Similar numbers may be found on the Plates and it’s possible this 2
    belongs on Plate XVII on page 68.
    </li>
    <li>Another copy of the original text in the Princeton Library includes a typewritten
    correction on page 13. The author and date of the correction is unclear, but reads ‘Page
    12, paragraph 3. The words “SOFT TIN” is a misprint and should be “IRON.”’
    </li>
    <li>The numbers and letters around the side of the illustrations correspond to numbered
    items in the text.  Numbers in the text link to the illustration including that item.

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>It is not the purpose of the author in this volume to
treat of the myriads of pressed glass dating from the
centennial to the present day masquerading in shops
as “Sandwich glass” and cluttering up the cabinets of
the unwary collector only to be discarded later by those
who have learned by comparison with the beautiful lacy
specimens of early Sandwich that they have been led to
acquire pieces of little beauty and less real value. It is
of the period of Sandwich glass dating from the opening
of the factory in 1825 by a handful of men, blowers
of great physique, artists, and mold makers, some of
whom started in the struggling “Parent Tree” factory
of 1817, down to the period of greatest prosperity in
1853—that we are dealing with. These men put their
best efforts into designs of intricate beauty. There is
no comparison between their work and the later commercial
pressed glass which took unto itself all the worst
features of Victorian decoration and which was never
found upon the tables of people of good taste, who
turned from pressed glass to English cut during this
latter period, or preserved with reverence and used on
state occasions the pieces of a generation before. This
late glass covered with stars and rosettes in ugly amber
and blue and white became a tremendous advertising
medium and was distributed as premiums and sold in
quantity at very cheap prices. The author sees no object
in collecting it to-day other than the commercializing
of an unworthy product. The glass sheltered by the
Mansard roof does not fit in with early Sandwich.</p>

  <h2 id='HIST' class='c004'><i>HISTORY</i> <br /> Forerunners of the Sandwich works—Evolution of the Industry</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1787 a factory was established on Essex Street,
Boston by Whalley, Hunnewell and others for making
crown window glass. This enterprise was not a success
until 1803 when a German by the name of Lint arrived.
From then on the factory became prosperous; the state
paid a bounty and by 1822 the glass had become
famous and was known as Boston Window glass. This
factory was given the exclusive right in their charter
for a number of years.</p>

<p class='c008'>In 1811 they erected a larger and improved factory
in South Boston, and sent to England for more blowers
of window glass but could not get them on account
of the war so they turned to using flint glass blowers,
previously brought from Europe. This factory in
South Boston was the “parent tree” of the Sandwich
works. It failed in the thirties and started
up again and failed many times but was running in
1854.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another Company was formed in 1811 called the
Porcelain and Glass Manufacturing Company at East
Cambridge but it failed in the production of both attempted
products because of poor management. The
plant was sold at auction November, 1817, and bought
by a new company which called itself The New England
Glass Company. This enterprise was successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>from the beginning—in 1817, thus we see that some
specimens of N. E. G. are of earlier date than Sandwich
glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>Its capital of $40,000 in 1817 increased until in
1853 it was $500,000. The start was a six pot furnace
with 700 pounds to each pot. Forty hands were employed
and the yearly product was $40,000. In 1853
there were five furnaces with ten pots of 2,000 pounds
each and 500 hands, and doing a business of $500,000.
The author hopes that this may throw some light upon
the incredulous amateur collector’s query of “Where
does all the old glass come from?”</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h2 class='c004'><i>ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SANDWICH GLASS WORKS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In 1825 a flint glass manufactory was established at
Sandwich, Massachusetts. Building was started in
April, and July 4th, 1825 they commenced blowing. It
was purchased in 1826 by a new company calling itself
The Boston and Sandwich Glass Company. The beginning
was an 8 pot furnace—each pot holding 800 pounds
and a yearly product of $75,000. There were at first 60
employees but by 1853 the capital was $400,000 with
weekly melts of 100,000 pounds—500 employees—four
furnaces of 10 pots producing yearly $600,000 worth of
cup plates, lamps, dishes, salt cellars, etcetra.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deming Jarves, one of the incorporators of the
Boston and Sandwich Glass Company, writes in 1854
as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“In 1825 a Flint Glass Manufactory was established
by individual enterprise in Sandwich, Massachusetts.
Ground was broke in April, dwellings for the workmen
built and the manufactory completed; and on July 4,
1825 they commenced blowing glass, three months after
first breaking ground.”</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early days of the factory the life of a glass
blower was short due to the overheated glass houses but
for twenty years prior to 1854 no employee of the Boston
and Sandwich Company died or was seriously ill from
his employment. The invention of the mold machine
saved many lives. The pressing mold for glass was invented
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>in 1827 by a workman named Robinson at the
New England Glass Company but was later adopted
and perfected by the Sandwich works.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>
  <h2 id='PG' class='c004'><i>PRESSED GLASS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Pressed glass was many times reheated to a point
sufficient to melt a thin surface layer—This was called
“fire polishing.” It removed any roughness due to the
process of molding and left a smooth bright surface.</p>

<p class='c008'>Flint glass—The name of flint glass was derived
from the fact that in England flints were calcined and
pulverized to make silica which is the main constituent of
glass. The use of flint made the glass highly refractive
and brilliant and oxide of lead which was also added
increased it.</p>

<p class='c008'>As pressed glass was the main product of the Sandwich
works the few blown specimens of the factory will
be taken up by the author in a separate volume dealing
with the blown pitchers, plates, flips, jars, and balls
blown at Willington, Westford, New London, Stoddard,
Lyndeboro, Keene, and Chelmsford.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>
  <h2 id='MOLD' class='c004'><i>MOLDS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The mold machine invented by the New England
Glass Works revolutionized the flint glass industry. By
its use glass could be pressed into any shape.</p>

<p class='c008'>Glass in melted form is not malleable but its
ductility is next to gold and by steady pressure can be
forced into any shape. The mass blown against and
into moulds was subjected to the stamp and penetrated
the most delicate carvings. In places the early stippled
specimens of Sandwich glass are only a thirty-second of
an inch in thickness. The resulting sharpness of detail
is wonderful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reason that nothing remains of the early molds
is accounted for by the fact that iron was a costly commodity
even as late as 1825. Thrift was responsible for
the success of our forefathers and the glass molds which
were made of soft tin were melted and re-run as they
became dull from usage. Original designs were destroyed
as new patterns were evolved. With the invention
of the stamping machine iron ladles were used to
pour the glass into the mold. We are often puzzled to
know why a pontil should appear on early specimens of
“pressed” glass. This is because the earlier specimens
were actually blown against and into the molds before
the invention of mechanical pressure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Soft Slip, a clay used in making the old Connecticut
slip ware dishes was run into a new mold. This proof
showed any imperfections as well as supplying the works
with a pattern for a new mold when necessary. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>proofs were easily broken and of little use at the factory
after a mold was discontinued.</p>

<p class='c008'>A poor impression was caused by a worn out mold
or as in the case of the very early plates made by plungers
before the stamp machine came into use, by insufficient
contact with the mold. The rarest type of Bunker
Hill cup plate illustrates this point.</p>

<p class='c008'>The carving of iron molds was called “Chipping”
and mold chippers were responsible for the art of the
finished product.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the New England Glass Company moved
to Ohio in the Eighties thousands of iron molds were
sold to junk dealers.</p>

  <h2 id='COMP' class='c004'><i>COMPOSITION</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Sandwich glass was made of silex, ash, nitre, pig
lead, and other ingredients but the secret of the bright
surface on old pressed glass, a characteristic which differentiates
it from the modern pressed glass, was the use
of barytes. This was introduced into the molten mass
and gave the beautiful silver tint that we find in early
glass. The New England Glass Company omitted this
barytes from its glass with resulting dullness. Its specimens
are all crude and heavy in comparison with the
lacy examples of early Sandwich.</p>

<p class='c009'>1. A small pocket lens is invaluable in studying the
designs on Sandwich glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>2. The mounting of specimens on black satine brings
out a higher refractive quality of the glass than when
mounted on velvet.</p>

<p class='c010'>3. Specimens that show signs of wear may be touched
up and made brilliant by a slight application of the
banana oil lacquer.</p>

<p class='c010'>4. “Rust” a term for the scum that rose to the surface
of the pot and had to be thoroughly removed by skimming,
often appears on specimens making them less valuable
for collection. A weak solution of acid will improve
the glass in such cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many interesting facts concerning Sandwich glass
have been gained from contact with owners of inherited
specimens in the remote districts of New England—in
many cases the descendants of glass blowers whose
knowledge is real, not based upon hearsay in going from
shop to shop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The popular term “Snake-skin” refers to the resemblance
of the stippled back ground in early Sandwich
glass to the skin of a snake. I like the term Lace glass
better as it more clearly conveys the delicacy of treatment.
There was a later glass produced by the Sandwich
works in 1875 in order to meet the popular demand
at less expense. This might well be called Snake-skin
because the stippling is so merged that the term applies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>to it much more than to the fine early specimen. This
glass was made in machine cut molds. There was more
background than detail and the pieces were sold in
cheap sets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Throughout this work the author has in every instance
purposely omitted the question of values. The
value of old things is not intrinsic. It is governed by the
demand and not by set prices. Inestimable harm has
been done unintentionally by popular magazine writers
who have quoted prices forgetting that those who go far
afield may pay to-day a large price for a piece that to-morrow
they find for a song, thus evening up the collecting
average. The mere quotation of a price means
nothing to the real collector but it immediately plants
in the minds of the uninitiated who do not discriminate
between their treasures the idea that they can get the
amount quoted and more next time and so the practice of
“hoarding” and “pyramiding” is established. It begins
with the farmer’s wife and does not stop with the dealer
and collector until the modest collector becomes discouraged
and his interest dies. To the very few who understand
the joy of exchanging duplicate specimens regardless
of value and of taking a small profit over what they
pay thus enabling them to complete their collections in
the spirit of olden days this book is dedicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the reproduction of blown glass is easier than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>pressed there is a certain joy in owning fine specimens
of the latter. The field is too broad and the designs too
intricate to tempt the modern mold maker. The machine
product is too obviously regular and lacks the silvery
brightness produced in old pressed glass by the use
of barytes and the artistic technique of the hand made
mold.</p>

  <h2 id='CP' class='c004'><i>CUP PLATES</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c011'>In the days when our forefathers considered it quite
correct to pour tea from the cup into the saucer and
drink it from the latter the problem still remained of
an unsightly ring upon the linen. Thus the cup plate
was evolved in the first place from a purely utilitarian
standpoint. It took the place of the modern coaster but
later became a subject for “table talk” in the form of
political and social reform. The thought and sentiment
of the times were worked into the dainty molds and the
resulting cup-plates became works of art.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first plates were crude and heavy but as time
went on less glass was blown against the molds with
greater force resulting in plates of brilliant stippling
and delicacy. New designs were carved until in 1840,
when the ship Constitution was about to be junked, to
arouse public opinion one of the most exquisite octagon
plates appeared—representing the highest art in Sandwich
glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>The invention of the stamp machine increased the
production and the little plates came away from the
molds with clearer and sharper edges and brilliancy of
detail. The first cup plates made were conventional or
geometrical patterns. The author owns one one-half
inch thick with pontil, a rare example of the first process.</p>

<p class='c008'>Previous to the period 1825-30 the dinner sets made
in England for the American market included cup plates
of china. During this time the conventional cup plates
were first put out by the Sandwich Glass Works and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>soon gained such great popularity, due both to their
beauty and their fitness with any china, that cup plates
were generally omitted from dinner sets thereafter.
People who could not afford entire dinner sets had previously
gone without cup plates and the glass cup plate
was an innovation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Distribution of their products was a great problem
at the Sandwich works. Much glass found its way over
the country by way of the tin peddlers cart. The finding
of a number of specimens in the same locality to-day
can often be traced back to a peddler who went out of
business in that particular town—his wares to be rediscovered
by a later generation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author has in her cup plate collection a slipware
“proof” of the ship Cadmus. This was the first run
of a new mold and served as a pattern from which to
take orders. The iron molds were too much in use to show
to prospective buyers and the little glass plates themselves
too fragile and hence the proof of red glazed clay
served the double purpose of showing necessary corrections
in a new mold and giving the company a “sample”
cup plate. These proofs are very rare as they seldom
got out of the hands of the factory and were destroyed
as new patterns were created to take the place of the
old.</p>

<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>dots, border like plate No. 7. This
plate is called the small Constitution by
many as the ship is undoubtedly the
same type of vessel but the plate was
gotten out to represent the Cadmus, the
ship which brought Lafayette to America
in 1824, and shows the early cruder
workmanship—See Camehl page 197.</p>

<p class='c015'><a href='#P3'>17.</a> The Constitution—Large square rigged ship in
center, inner border type of No. 7, octagonal
plate of exquisite workmanship.
Note cover design of this book. This
cup plate represents the acme of Sandwich
glass designing. It was issued when
feeling was running high against the
probable “junking” of the Constitution
in hopes that public opinion might
change the fate of the old sailing vessel.</p>

<div class='c014'>Very Rare.</div>

<p class='c015'><a href='#P3'>18.</a> Pennsylvania steam boat-octagonal. This is the
companion piece to the Constitution.
The inner border varies in that it has
four shields and scrolls in a background
of horizontal lines. In popular magazine
articles this boat has been called the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>Fulton but any one familiar with the old
wood cuts of Robert Fulton’s steam boat
will note that they do not bear the slight slightest
resemblance to the boat on the cup-plate
whereas it is the almost exact
counter part of the side wheeler Pennsylvania
that plied the Ohio River.
Further Fulton’s boats had one mast
for sailing in case of trouble.</p>

<p class='c008'>I refer my reader to the “Blue China Book,” by
Camehl page 224, “City of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
Steam Boat,” by Clews, and to page 231, “Fulton Steam
Boat” and ask them to draw their own conclusion. The
political situation in regard to navigation on the Ohio
River at this time has further bearing on the subject. A
further note that will substantiate this claim is that in a
careful check list of known specimens kept and much
research work done along the lines of glass found in a
given locality, the majority of these rare little octagonal
cup plates and the still rarer large plates with the same
ship in the center have come out of Pennsylvania, showing
that the Pennsylvania Steam Boat would be likely to
find a readier sale there than elsewhere. It appealed to
the States pride as prior to the Civil War, States Rights
were a much more prominent issue than later on.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible to describe fully the vast number of
conventional cup plates but there are two in the author’s
collection that do not fit into any group. One “<a href='#P9'>A</a>” has 26
large stars on a clear field. N. E. G. It is a very early
plate and I like to call it “the States.” The other “<a href='#P9'>C</a>” is a
later plate of which I do not know of a duplicate. The
center is a feathered nine pointed star in octagon medallion
and the border is a mother goose design with
four children, four trees, a pig, and other nursery rhyme
scenery. We illustrate these together with a rare slipware

but were not found practical because of the expense connected
with their manufacture. Many people considered
them not in good taste for table use but the opalescent
conventional plates were more popular. These have
necessarily become rare and the collector who goes in
for colored plates to any extent has a hard undertaking

been made in lovely shades of lavender, green, amber,
mauve, and blue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tints or “off-shades” are much sought after by collectors

  <h2 id='GS' class='c004'><i>PRESSED GLASS SALTS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c011'>Many of the little salts used on our grandmothers’
tables reflected the political feeling of the times
as did the cup plates, and in noting the following
from the Sandwich works I am including a number of
specimens which the New England Glass factory made
in imitation of the Sandwich at the time. These will be
marked N. E. G. in the text. These are heavier, less
transparent, and are from molds crudely carved. The
period is 1840.</p>

<p class='c008'>One salt has come to light marked Robinson &amp;
Son, Pittsburgh, Pa. It is a boat salt similar to the
Lafayette boat made at Sandwich but shorter and
broader. It is of clear glass of a later type. Blown
glass salts will be taken up in a subsequent book by the
author. The beautiful conventional designs produced
by artists of the Sandwich Glass Company are so numerous
and delicate in workmanship that we illustrate as
many varieties as possible hoping that collectors of these
charming little pieces will understand our purpose and
forgive omissions of specimens that they hold dear. All
salts shown are from the author’s collection and most of
them are in pairs, but we show one only for reference.
New varieties are being found daily adding to the fascination
of collecting. The following types are worthy
of note:</p>

  <h2 id='VA' class='c004'><i>VICTORIAN ANIMALS</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c011'>For the West Mustard Company about 1870 the
Sandwich works made a number of designs consisting
of chickens and other animals on nests of
semi opaque white glass. Many of these had glass eyes
and the less common ones found to-day are in colors, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>remarkable blue predominating. These were filled with
their products, labeled with a red and orange label and
sold to the public destined later to become useful receptacles.
Many collectors of these objects confuse the
marbled glass which comes in mauve and white and ocre
and white in many designs similar to the above with the
Sandwich of this late period. This marbled glass in
Whieldon effects was made at Phoenixville, Pa., and
may be put in the same class as the advertising of the
West Mustard Co. During this last period of the Sandwich
Glass Works their products became cheapened to
meet the demand of commercial advertising and an endless
number of cheap glass premiums were sent out
to all parts of the country in the era just preceding the
soap wrapper and the patent medicine man.</p>

<p class='c008'>An interesting bit of information in regard to the
opalescent edges often found on pieces of Victorian glass
is that this opalescence was produced by re-heating the
edges to a dull red heat after it was molded.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pattern for the opaque glass chickens was inspired
by the early Staffordshire hens. This has led
many to believe that the former were made in England
but they are decidedly a late Sandwich product made
of the same composition as many of the lamps and candlesticks.
The author has found nests bearing the original
orange and red labels of the West Mustard Company.</p>

  <h2 id='CS' class='c004'>CANDLESTICKS <br /> <i>HOW TO TELL OLD STICKS FROM NEW</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>1. Genuine old glass candlesticks were always molded
in two sections and fused together. This fusing section
varies from one-sixteenth to one-quarter inch in thickness
and is irregular on different sides of the same stick.
This is an absolute test and never fails.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. If you will examine the mold seams along the side of
the stick you will find that where the sections are joined
the perpendicular line is not continuous. The seam
may be in line on one side but turn the stick and you
will find the rule holds good. This is because in fusing
the parts by hand they were slightly rotated and it was
impossible to keep the mold seams in a straight line.
Also the old hand carved molds varied slightly in size so
that no two tops and bottoms were exactly alike. The
modern glass candlestick is molded in one section
released from machine made molds and the side line
is continuous from top to bottom. This test should be
applied to all the colored glass sticks of the hollow base
type that are appearing. The earlier sticks with scarred
bases have not been imitated except in shapes never
found in old glass. Reproductions of blown glass will
be taken up by the author in another book.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. The collector of American glassware finds a very
handsome type of candlestick with blown bobèche top
and molded base. It is safe to say that these tops were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>imported from England for use at the Sandwich works.
They are only found on the most expensive sticks of the
period, and are identical with English candlesticks of
the same time, except for the typical Sandwich pedestal
and base, fused to the blown bobèche. We know that
elaborate lamp bowls were imported and combined with
Sandwich glass bases and later joined with brass standards
to marble bases, thus it is safe to assume that many
of the elaborate candlesticks are in part of similar origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Dolphin Candlesticks are found in seven distinct
types. The single base usually has two scars near
the hollow base of the Dolphin showing the earliest form
of ejection from the mold, a kind of modified pontil.
The single base Dolphins while not as delicate in modelling
and design are decidedly earlier and much rarer
than the double base. The head of the Dolphin is
hollow for a greater distance than in the double base
sticks showing that these earlier forms were blown into
the molds before the stamp machine was in common use.
There is also a sunken bobash of glass not found in the
double base types.</p>

<p class='c008'>Type 6 and 7 is mentioned by the author with reluctance
as it is of Victorian origin. The little pentagonal
base stick type 5 is dainty and well molded but the bell
shaped Dolphin is ornate and of less value to collectors.
The dishes on Dolphin standards with opalescent edges
are of this period also and mentioned only to make this

  <h2 id='OIL' class='c004'><i>WHALE OIL LAMPS</i> <br /> Period of 1850</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c011'>A burner was invented consisting of two tin tubes
soldered to a brass or pewter screw cap. This
took the place of the single tube of the earlier
lamps and gave a double flame. It was adaptable to use
in lamps of ornamental glass and the enterprising Sandwich
factory at once started the manufacture of pressed
glass lamps to meet the demand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The earliest type was in clear glass. Later more
elaborate and costly forms were introduced and a blown
receptacle for the oil fused to a molded base often had
a beautiful blown center section. The patterns in these
old lamps are endless. Etched and cut tops were imported
and fused to Sandwich bases at the factory.
The Victorian era brought in a demand for two color
combinations and opaque glass lamps. We stop at the
introduction of marble bases as they are very much later
and the bowls for many of these lamps were foreign.
No attempt has been made to illustrate all specimens, a
few of the more decorative being chosen. With the
early lamps no shade was used and the flickering flame
of the spirit tubes gave little better light than candles
but it saved the housewife the endless dipping and molding.
The wick had to be constantly picked through the
small opening at the side of the burner as it burned
down. The fluid used was camphine. This is proof alone
that no shade was used. The glass shades came into use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>with the “boudoir burner” which took a flat wick through
a round opening patented by E. M. &amp; Company in 1865.
At this time people fitted the earlier lamp with these
burners and substituted a new fluid for the earlier whale
oil and camphine. We illustrate a very rare lamp of
clear white glass with Dolphin standard in the Dolphin
group.</p>

<p class='c015'>Type <a href='#P19'>1.</a> New England Glass Works, blown top,
molded four sided base column at end, baskets
of fruit on each side, lions’ heads at
corners, a very early and rare lamp.</p>

<p class='c015'>Type <a href='#P19'>2.</a> Fluted overlaid molded howl, four sided
base with two steps with fluted Colonial
Column joining base and bowl.
Colors similar to Type 6.</p>

<p class='c015'>Type <a href='#P19'>3.</a> Shows a lamp of rare design. The quality
of the glass in the fragile scrolled base with
lion’s claw feet is very early, and the frosted
blown bowl of great delicacy. Lamps
are seldom found of this type which closely
resembles the flatware of the first period.</p>

<p class='c015'>Type <a href='#P19'>4.</a> Was a costlier product. It was fused in
three parts and included a bulbous blown
center section and cutting was often introduced
on the bowl.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Type <a href='#P19'>5.</a> The most popular inexpensive lamp of the
period was a molded lamp in various designs,
clear glass hearts, lyres, diamonds,
bulls eye, and hob nail patterns appealing
to the public. The molds were heavily
grouved and fine stippling was avoided because
this caused greater tendency to
breakage which was undesirable in anything
containing inflammable material.</p>

blue, opalescent, and purple glass. Not many of the
colored ones have survived hard usage and the white
many sided bowls with covers are getting very difficult
to find.</p>

<p class='c008'>Little toy pieces were made at the works in the
early period such as covered tureens, tiny plates and platters,
dolls’ cream pitchers, etc. These are not illustrated
as the detail is too fine to be of value.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The author has a <a href='#P26'>collection</a> of nearly thirty pieces
in this design, many of the pieces being pontil marked.
This pattern matched the candle sticks of type 1.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some few pieces have been found in this pattern in
vaselene yellow and purple. The secret of yellow
glass was conveyed to the Sandwich factory by a workman
from Bristol, England. The process was too costly
to admit of the manufacture of many pieces in this
color. Some lovely scent bottles were made, lamps,
vases and candle sticks and the author has a pair of rare
salts on standards. We refer of course to the earlier
pieces as Victorian yellow glass is found in abundance.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h2 id='PP' class='c004'><i>PRESENTATION PIECES</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>For special occasions the Sandwich works got out
dishes to be presented as souvenirs. These show special
designing and are exceedingly rare. We illustrate a
<a href='#P25'>piece</a> issued for the Prince of Wales’ visit to America.
Also a <a href='#P25'>piece</a> known to have been made at Sandwich in
simulated English design with words “Gladstone” and
“For The Million,” thistle center.</p>

<p class='c008'>The “Victoria” plate, 7 inch, shows the head of the
young Queen—in size like George Washington’s head in
the Washington cup plate—with “Victoria” above and
with a beautifully stippled lace border of the early period.
An exquisite and rare plate.</p>

<div class='c017'>Not illustrated.</div>

<p class='c008'>No mention is made in this volume of the endless
President Garfield, railroad trains, puss in boots, and
Venus designs whose name is Legion and without whose
presence the cabinet of the true collector will not suffer,
such pieces looking entirely out of place on the shelves
with early Sandwich.</p>

<p class='c008'>As personalities are painful to the collector I have
tried to refrain from them in this volume, trusting that
those who have something to add or subtract from my
text will do so in a kindly spirit. We as Americans are
too prone to make our collections general. We seek
quantity rather than quality and the author is a believer
in elimination. <a id='DONT'></a>The following are a few suggestions for
the amateur collector:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>1. Don’t think you have the best collection until
you have seen others.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. Don’t think that money can buy the best specimens,
courtesy and patience can buy better.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. In collecting old glass he who “hesitates” has
lost it to his neighbor.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. Don’t believe all you hear—investigate.</p>

<p class='c008'>5. Don’t collect EARLY “WOOLWORTH.”</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Don’t let envy keep you from enjoying and
studying another’s collection.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. Don’t tell everybody what you are looking for,
a rival collector is born every minute.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. Don’t seek numbers of specimens, seek fine
workmanship.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. Don’t call everything that you cannot classify
Canadian, English, or Spanish. Comparison of specimens
and time will change your opinion.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. Don’t quote prices for by so doing the market
is ruined for both dealer and collector. The value is according
to what you pay and to-morrow you may obtain
the same piece for more or less.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>11. Don’t keep your glass in a dark cup-board
done up in paper. Let others enjoy the fruits of your
labor.</p>

<p class='c008'>12. Considering that everyone’s taste is not alike
“an unfair exchange is no robbery.”</p>

<p class='c008'>13. Don’t say a thing is “very rare” or “very common”
remembering that what is rare in Pennsylvania
may be common in Massachusetts. Most antiques depend
upon locality for their rarity and your opinion may
be very local.</p>

<p class='c008'>14. Don’t subject old glass to very hot or very cold
water in washing. Early Sandwich is subject to atmospheric
conditions. Sudden changes of heat and cold
will cause cracks.</p>

<p class='c008'>15. Last and not least, don’t “hoard”; give the
other collector a chance. By exchange and sale of specimens
you will improve your own collection and if you
help some one else to get what he wants it will come back
to you ten fold in unexpected moments. An old house,
old glass and old friends is a combination worth living
for.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
